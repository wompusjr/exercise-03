## EDA Challenge for Exercise 3

## Loading the Data

Prior to manipulating the data I loaded it into an R script with the following code. I chose file.choose() over a direct link out of habit. Doing this

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
f <- file.choose()
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
```

Doing this created a ***tibble*** with [213 observations]{.underline} and [23 variables]{.underline}

## Challenge 1-3: Creating Variables

First step was to a create the [BSD]{.underline} (ratio of average male body mass to average female body mass), [sex_ratio]{.underline} (ratio of all male members to all female members in a species), and [DI]{.underline} (ratio of day range length to the diameter of the home range) variables in **d**. I did that by dividing the relevant columns for each new variable and loading the result as a new column in the tibble.

For [DI]{.underline}, I had to calculate the diameter from the area in kilometers squared. I first created a vector for each of the variables radii which was the square root of *HomeRange_km2* divided by pi. Then I created a new variable that was the **r** vector multiplied by 2, which multiplied two across each number.

(I also attached the tibble to make it easier to do this)

```{r}
#| eval: false
attach(d)
d$BSD <- (Body_mass_male_mean/Body_mass_female_mean)
d$sex_ratio <- (AdultMales/AdultFemale)
r <- sqrt(HomeRange_km2)/pi
d$diameter <- r*2
d$DI <- (DayLength_km/(diameter))
```

## Challenge 4-6: Plotting

Second step was to plot some of these to answer some basic questions about the data. For these plots, I used ggplot for it's aesthetic value and customization.

### Challenge 4

On average, across all primates, there appears to be slight correlation between time spent moving and total range covered in day (**Figure 4.1**).However, when we look at each family individually, only *Atelidae* and *Cercopithecidae* really show any slight correlation between more time spent moving and more distance covered (**Figure 4.2**)

```{r}
#| eval: false
##day length by time spent moving
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = log(Move), y = log(DayLength_km), #log is applied to normalize the data
                          color = factor(Family)))
p <- p + xlab("log(Move)") + ylab("log(DayLength_km)")
p <- p + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
p <- p + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
p #checking first graph of them all together
p <- p + facet_wrap(~Family, ncol = 4)
p <- p + theme(legend.position = "none")
p #checking faceted graphs

```

### Challenge 5

On average, across all primates, there appears to be strong correlation between time spent moving and the average group size in a species (**Figure 5.1**). Looking across Family, most families follow the same correlation; however, *Lemuridae* exhibits only slight correlation and *Hylobatidae* seems to have no correlation at all (**Figure 5.2**).

```{r}
#| eval: false
##day length by avg. group size
p2 <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = log(MeanGroupSize), y = log(DayLength_km), #log is applied to normalize the data
                          color = factor(Family)))
p2 <- p2 + xlab("log(Avg. Group Size)") + ylab("log(Day Range Length)")
p2 <- p2 + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
p2 <- p2 + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
p2 #checking first graph of them all together
p2 <- p2 + facet_wrap(~Family, ncol = 4)
p2 <- p2 + theme(legend.position = "none")
p2 #checking faceted graphs

```

### Challenge 6

On average, across all primates, there appears to be strong correlation between canine size dimorphism and the overall body size dimorphism in a species (**Figure 6.1**). Looking at each family individually reveals that only *Cercopithecidae, Cebidae, Galagidae,* and *Hylobatidae* really show a positive correlation. Some families, like *Atelidae,* even had a negative correlation (**Figure 6.2**).

```{r}
#| eval: false
##canine dimorphism by body dimorphism 
p3 <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = log(BSD), y = log(Canine_Dimorphism),#log for convenience
                           color = factor(Family)))
p3 <- p3 + xlab("log of Body Sex Dimorphism") + ylab("log or Canine Dimorphism") 
p3 <- p3 + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
p3 <- p3 + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
p3 #checking total plot
p3 <- p3 + facet_wrap(~Family, ncol = 4)
p3 <- p3 + theme(legend.position = "none")
p3 #checking facetted plot
```

## Challenge 7: Diet Strategy

The third step was to create a new variable *diet_strategy* and to plot it.

After using the mutate() and ifelse() functions to create the new variable and loading it into the previous **d** tibble. I then had to create a secondary tibble with the NA rows in *diet_strategy* omitted so they wouldn't be accounted for in my boxplot. This second structure was called **dnoNA.**

Plotting the results (**Figure 7**) reveals that on average frugivores tend to live in similar sized groups as folivores and omnivores; although ominivores interquartile range encompasses large group sizes. Frugivore species do have a much larger range than either other strategy.

```{r}
#| eval: false
d <- mutate(d, diet_strategy = ifelse(Fruit >= 50, "frugivore", ifelse(Leaves >= 50, "folivore",
                                                                   ifelse(Fruit < 50 & Leaves < 50, "omnivore", NA))))
dnoNA <- d |> drop_na(diet_strategy)
#plotting
p4 <- ggplot(data = dnoNA, aes(x = diet_strategy, y = log(MeanGroupSize))) #loging for convenience
p4 <- p4 + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE)
p4 <- p4 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
p4 <- p4 + ylab("avg. group size")
p4
```

## Challenge 8: Piping

The final step was to create a pipe of some basic dplyr verbs and then finish with the print() function.

I used mutate() to add a new column called Binomial to the data frame, then group_by() to group the data together, summarize() to return means for *Brain_Size_Species_Mean* and *Body_mass_male_mean*, and then finally arrange() to order the table by the mean of brain size from the summarize() results.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mutate(d, Binomial = paste(Genus, Species, sep = " ")) %>%
  select(Binomial, Family, Brain_Size_Species_Mean, Body_mass_male_mean) %>%
  group_by(Family) %>%
  summarize(avgbrain = mean(Brain_Size_Species_Mean, na.rm = TRUE), avgbody = mean(Body_mass_male_mean,
                                                                          na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(avgbrain)%>%
  print()
```
